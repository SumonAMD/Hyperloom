    already writes, so "this build produced the environment the round validated"

    then joined by ``Path(attempt_root).name == task_id``; being an equality it
    is order-independent, so concurrent completions interleaving in the manifest
    cannot bind a step to another build's row.

    The round is ``last_specialist_task_id`` while that marker is set, and

    key a recipe on: it is one-shot, consumed the moment a specialist-requested

    at has usually cleared it. The kept rounds live as long as the recipe does,
    and a build requested by a round that was kept is part of the accepted stack
    whether or not it was the last one.

    A sentinel is recognized by that equality alone, never by the absence of an
    outcome: routing merges its fields into the attempt row of the same build
    whenever one is already in the manifest, which for a build the executor ran
    is always, so the linked sentinel and the joined row are usually one row.
