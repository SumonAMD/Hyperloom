    :func:`_expected_op_reasons` walks ``accepted_stack_targets`` and asks
    whether each target it names was captured. That direction cannot see a
    target the producer never named: a capture derived from the final round
    alone declares that round's files, the snapshot holds exactly them, the
    comparison passes -- and the recipe still emits one patch step per round,
    every earlier one replaying files nothing verified. Judged the other way
    round, each step must account for itself, so a recipe covering fewer rounds
    than it replays is refused by the deciding side rather than only by the
    producing side happening to be correct.

    Two things are checked, and neither is "does this step's operation match the
    snapshot":

    * COVERAGE -- every file a step touches is named by the accepted stack and
      present in that root's capture. This is what catches a recipe replaying
      more rounds than were captured.
    * END-STATE AGREEMENT -- for each file, the LAST step that declares it
      agrees with the operation the accepted stack records. That ordered fold is
      how the producer builds the stack summary, so a disagreement means the
      step list and the summary describe different end states.

    A step's own operation is an INTERMEDIATE state while the snapshot is the
    final one, so comparing them directly would refuse a legitimate stack: a
    round that deletes a file and a later round that recreates it is correct,
    ends as an upsert, and must certify. Refusing a valid stack costs the
    verdict its meaning as surely as certifying a broken one.

    Defects already owned elsewhere are skipped so one defect yields one code: a
    step whose ``root_id`` matches no root record is ``root_unidentified``, and
    a root whose capture returned no manifest is ``source_snapshot_missing``.

    Args:
        section: The emitted section, read for ``accepted_stack_targets``.
        by_root: Snapshot manifests keyed by ``root_id``.
        steps: The projected recipe steps.
